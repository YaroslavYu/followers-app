Greetings. This repository provides an application for working with tweets. You
can download users with information about their followers and tweets. You can
also follow or unfollow a user if you are already a follower. For convenience,
you can filter the tweets that you see on the screen. But additional upload is
only available if all tweets are displayed.

To install the application, you need to enter in the console "npm install". To
start, you must enter "npm start". A browser tab will open automatically. If you
want to go manually, in the browser tab, enter
"http://localhost:3000/followers-app"

Already working assembled version is located at
"https://yaroslavyu.github.io/followers-app" Upon clicking, you will be taken to
the main page. To get to the tweets, click on "tweets" on the main page. The app
will redirect you to a page where you can view some of the tweets, follow or
unfollow, filter tweets, and download more. To return to the main page, click
"back"-button.
